            I am a third year Student studying at the University of Toronto
            Scarborough in its Computer Science Co-op program, specializing in Software Engineering.

            Most of my experience in programming has been independent, but recently I have taken
            some university courses that has let me attempt programming in groups. It is a lot
            harder than independent work, but I understand it is very important to learn how to work
            in a team for future endeavors. I look forward to more opportunities to do so.

            Thanks for taking the time to read through my website. I know it's not the best, and none
            of it is original (even the color scheme is from a youtube tutorial) but I really hope I can
            make improvements in the future. Something I've learned in my time at university is that everything
            takes a really long time to learn, and I am especially slow in the brain. So bear with me.
